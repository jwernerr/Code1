<a href="http://www.ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=index">Nice cheatsheet I found</a>
<h2>L01.1_GitHub_Markdown</h2>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>created a GitHub account</li>
    <li>created repository called "Code1"
      <ul>
        <li>repository = storage location for software packages</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>created (this) markdown page (update: changed to html)</li>
    <li>edited<a href="https://github.com/MiaGMB/Caffeine-">group repository</a></li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>L01.2_Git_VS</h2>

<ul>
  <li>cloned Code1 repository to computer
    <ul>
      <li>get link on button <>Code</li>
      <li>open Git Bash,type git clone (link)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>made some local changes and pushed them to GitHub
    <ul>
      <li>important: edit message, else it will be stuck loading forever</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Task: Discuss certain concepts:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Repository: storage location for software packages (remote or local)</li>
  <li>Commit: finalize changes</li>
  <li>Branch: two separate paths of the same file</li>
  <li>Remote: not local/on your computer</li>
</ul>

<h3>Task: Familiarize yourself with these Git actions:</h3>
- stage: add to the index<br>
- commit: captures a snapshot of the projects currently staged changes<br>
- fetch: fetch the commits of a remote repository into local repository<br>
- push: upload local repository content to a remote repository<br>
- pull: fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match the content<br>
- merge: join two or more development histories together<br>

<h2>L01.3_Git_Other</h2>
<h3>Task: Solve the following problems:</h3>
- How do you exclude a file from being tracked by Git?<br>
File called .gitignore in which you can specify filenames, directory names, ...<br>
- You have changes but you want roll everything back to the last commit, discarding all the changes.<br>
git reset --hard<br>
- You have changes but you want roll everything back to the last commit, discarding all the changes temporarily.<br>
<br>
- Remove all untracked files from local folder:<br>
git clean<br>
- Difference between these merge strategies:<br>
<ul>
  <li>merge: carry over all commit history from feature branch and will add an extra dummy commit to Master branch</li>
  <li>rebase: rewinds your commits and replays those commits again from the tip of the master branch</li>
  <li>squash like Merge except that it doesnâ€™t carry over commit history from feature branch and only dummy commit is created with the title of Pull Request</li>
</ul>

<h3>Task: Answer these questions:</h3>
- What does Visual Studio Code mean by "Sync Changes"?<br>
